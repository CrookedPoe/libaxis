#libaxis

Making a library is hard.

libaxis is what's left of a sort of abandoned idea for an N64 homebrew engine named [axis-engine](https://github.com/Drahsid/axis-engine), hence its name. It's a multipurpose C library that includes a powerful collection of some of the following utilities:
- Vector Calculation (2d, 3d, 4d and Quaternions)
- Matrix Transformation
- Color Space Conversion (RGB, HSV)
- General useful math.

I've never made a library by myself before, and the largest contributions were initially written by [@Drahsid](https://github.com/Drahsid), so there's bound to be some problems with the code, but I'll fix bugs as I find them.
